# Mini-Online-Store
The Mini Online Store Database project demonstrates the use of SQL and DBMS concepts to manage customers, products, orders, and order details. It uses relational tables, primary and foreign keys, and SQL queries to store data, calculate order totals, and generate sales and order reports efficiently.

The Mini Online Store Database Project is designed to demonstrate the practical implementation of Database Management System (DBMS) concepts using SQL by simulating the core functionality of an online shopping system. The database manages customers, products, orders, and order details in a structured relational manner. It consists of four main tables: Customers, Products, Orders, and Order_Details, which are connected through primary keys and foreign keys to ensure data integrity and proper relationships. The Customers table stores personal information such as name, email, phone number, and address, with a unique email constraint to prevent duplicate records. The Products table maintains product details including name, category, price, and available stock, using CHECK constraints to ensure valid pricing and stock values. The Orders table records customer orders along with order dates and total amounts and is linked to customers through a foreign key. The Order_Details table stores item-wise order information such as purchased products, quantity, and price, and connects orders with products using foreign key relationships. The project covers essential SQL functionality including table creation with constraints, insertion of sample data, calculation of total bill amounts, and retrieval of useful information such as all orders, customer order history, best-selling products, and complete order reports with item-wise billing. Overall, this project helps in understanding table relationships, primary and foreign keys, aggregate functions like SUM(), JOIN operations, and real-world database design for an online store.
